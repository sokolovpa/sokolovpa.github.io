Hi there!

My name is Pavel, and I am a technical writer. My focus is software documentation. Since 2019, I have worked on several projects documenting APIs and SaaS solutions.

Before becoming a technical writer, I worked as a sales consultant at Oracle, consulting clients on Oracle database and cloud services.

I started my career as a software developer. Altogether, I have over 15 years of experience in the software industry.
