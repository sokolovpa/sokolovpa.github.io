# What’s new in the latest GalacticHub release

Hello, GalacticHub team!
A new release of the GalacticHub platform is coming out, and we want to keep you informed about what’s new.

## New features

With this release, we are making GalacticHub more robust to help our customers be more productive.

### Dynamic data widgets

GalacticHub provides a lot of valuable data to the user. Until now, the users had to download Excel files and manually create data visualizations.
This new feature allows users to add interactive real-time data visualizations to their dashboards.

#### Current limitations:
* No custom date ranges. Users can view data for the past 30, 60, or 90 days.
* Users can place up to 6 widgets at a time on their dashboard.

### External calendar integration

Project managers and participants can now sync GalacticHub to an external calendar. This allows users to view all the important project dates in their favorite calendar application. With this new feature, users can be more efficient and avoid missing project deadlines.

#### High-level overview
* Users configure external calendar integration in their profile settings.
* Users select projects, milestones, and tasks to sync.
* Updates to the selected projects, milestones, and tasks are automatically reflected in the user’s external calendar.

## Feature enhancements

### Intuitive project navigation

The improved project navigation interface aligns with the project and task hierarchy. This means that the users can access their project information faster with fewer clicks.

### Smart search

We are enhancing the search functionality within GalacticHub.
* The improved search offers AI-generated suggestions in the search bar drop-down.
* Users now have the option to filter the search results to narrow down their search.

## Platform improvements

### SOC 2 compliance

To meet the demands of many potential customers, we have upgraded the data encryption protocols to meet SOC 2 compliance requirements.

### Increased availability

To improve the platform’s stability and performance, we have upgraded the backend infrastructure. Customers should now experience much better response times.
