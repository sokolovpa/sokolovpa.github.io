# The latest GalacticHub update is here

This update is all about helping you be more productive. We've enhanced project navigation and introduced several other improvements to make the platform more versatile.
Here is what's new:

## Customize your dashboard with interactive real-time data visualizations

Say hello to Dynamic data widgets. No more data file downloads! The widgets allow you to customize your dashboard by adding up to six interactive data visualizations that get updated in real time. Choose to display data for the past 30, 60, or 90 days.

## Connect GalacticHub to your external calendar

Sync projects in GalacticHub with your favorite calendar application to get reminders and keep track of all your deadlines in one place.

## Hierarchical project navigation

We have made project navigation more intuitive. The platform interface is now aligned with the hierarchy of your projects and tasks to help you access all your information quickly.

## Smart search

You can now filter the search results and leverage AI-generated suggestions in the search bar.

## Improved stability and compliance

We took note of your feedback and upgraded our infrastructure to increase the platform's stability and improve performance.
And, with upgrades to the data encryption protocols, the platform is now SOC 2 compliant.

_Enjoy!_
